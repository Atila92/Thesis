=================================
Laursen's XeLaTeX thesis template
=================================

This is an alternative to the "LUKE'S PHD THESIS TEMPLATE 1.2" used as standard layout for the
thesis written at DTU Compute.

The template is using the Memoir class which includes a lot of use full and predefined commands. See the
"Miscellaneous" chapter of the Memoir manual. Furthermore it uses XeLaTeX for maximum unicode support and
for the support of using local fonts.

Requirements
============

Standard (updated) TeX Live package including XeLaTeX and BibTeX.

Fonts
-----
The setup uses the following fonts:

* `Computer Modern Unicode <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm-unicode>`_
* `TeX Gyre Adventor <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/tex-gyre>`_

They are contained in TeXLive and MiKTeX setup by default so no extra setup is necessary.
If you want more unicode support in math mode use the
`Latin Modern Math <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/lm-math>`_ by uncomment the lines in
the bottom of ``preamble/fonts.tex``. NB there are `hyperref errors with math symbols using this font in
headings <http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/131627>`_.

Note that `Neo Sans <http://www.monotype.co.uk/neosans/>`_ font (DTU's main font) is the ultimative font
for headings. A similar font called Neo Sans Intel is also a good alternative which typically contains
more symbols. If the Neo Sans (Intel) font are installed on your system (un)comment the respective lines
in ``preamble/fonts.tex``.
